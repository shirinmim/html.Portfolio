<h1>The best movie according to Shirin</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pulp fiction</h3>
<p>Quentin Tarantino masterly interwove the story of two hitmen with other criminals by spicing up some romantic subplot.</p>
<h3>Babel</h3>
<p>An accedent effected four diffrent group of people</p>
<h3>Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring</h3>
<p>A movie full of beautiful scenery, a slow rhythm but it must seen.</p>
